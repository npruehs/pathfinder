Pathfinder
==========

Pathfinder illustrates different shortest path algorithms.

The top left shows a map of 300 x 300 tiles. Use the Unwalkable brush to the
right to block parts of the map for the pathfinding algorithm. When you're
finished, set the start and finish points of the path to find.

The tool offers three different pathfinding algorithms: Dijkstra, A* and
growing a rapidly-exploring random tree.

Click on Find Path to make the tool try to find a path from start to finish.
All visited tiles will be painted yellow, and the resulting path will be
painted green.
